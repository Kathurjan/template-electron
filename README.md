# Template Electron Angular App

This repository provides a template for building Electron applications using Angular.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kathurjan/template-electron.git
    cd template-electron
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the Angular development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will launch the Angular application in your browser.
4.  **Run Electron (in a separate terminal):**
    ```bash
    npm run electron
    ```
    This will build the Angular app and open the Electron application window.
5.  **Building the application for distribution:**
    ```bash
    npm run dist
    ```
    This will build the Angular app and create distributable packages in the `release` directory.



## Auto-Update Configuration

This template is configured for auto-updates using `electron-updater` and a generic provider.

**How it Works:**

1.  **Publishing Updates:**
    * When you run `npm run dist`, `electron-builder` creates your application's distributable (`.exe` for Windows) and generates `latest.yml` and blockmap files in the `release` directory.
    * These files are then uploaded to the specified `url` in the `publish` section of your `package.json` (currently `https://electron-template.surge.sh/`).
    * The `latest.yml` file contains metadata about the latest release, and the blockmap files help with efficient delta updates.

2.  **Client-Side Update Check:**
    * The application, upon launch, checks for updates by fetching the `latest.yml` file from the specified URL.
    * If a new version is available, it downloads the update and prompts the user to install it.

**Setting Up Auto-Updates for Your Own Project:**

1.  **Choose a Hosting Provider:**
    * You need a web server or hosting service to host your update files (`.exe`, `latest.yml`, blockmaps). You can use services like GitHub Releases, AWS S3, or any web server.
    * If you want to use Surge.sh like in the template, you will first need to install it with `npm install -g surge`.

2.  **Update `package.json`:**
    * Modify the `publish` section in your `package.json` to point to your hosting URL.
        ```json
        "publish": [
          {
            "provider": "generic",
            "url": "https://electron-template.surge.sh/" <--- change this to what you are hosting your files on.
          }
        ]
        ```

3.  **Upload Update Files:**
    * After building your application, upload the generated `.exe`, `latest.yml`, and blockmap files to your hosting location.
    * For Surge.sh, after installing it, you would navigate to your root folder of where "release" is in, "surge ./release electron-template.surge.sh" and follow the prompts
